# Project Description
The University of Alabama in Huntsville's 2020-2021 INCLUDE project answering the Grand Challenge of getting society interested in commercial space travel.

INCLUDE is a campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate student experience to examine Grand Challenges that are most likely to affect the future of humankind and help to better prepare society for new challenges and opportunities. With the guidance of a steering committee of mentors from both academia and practice, students will immerse in a project that explores innovative approaches and models to a predefined Grand Challenge. The Grand Challenge presented to student teams requires knowledge and experiences from multiple disciplines, with best solutions found at the intersection of each discipline. The project also examines the distinctive characteristics and missions of the independent disciplines that enable solutions to the world’s largest challenges. The project for the 20-21 academic year is in collaboration with NASA, Dynetics, and AOA.
